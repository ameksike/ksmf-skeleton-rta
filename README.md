# KsMf RTA Skeleton 
Simple Real Time App Template based on KsMf. Note that, a real-time application (RTA) is an application program that functions within a time frame that the user senses as immediate or current. The latency must be less than a defined value, usually measured in seconds. Whether or not a given application qualifies as an RTA depends on the worst-case execution time (WCET), the maximum length of time a defined task or set of tasks requires on a given hardware platform. The use of RTAs is called real-time computing (RTC).

This application prototype offers a general structure that allows you to create simple Real Time App projects. Note that a full stack application is one that contains both code that runs in web browsers with Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), and code that runs on the server to implement business logic.

- The code that is executed in web browsers to implement interaction with users through graphical interfaces, generally uses framweworks and libraries such as [Angular](https://angular.io/docs), [React](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/), etc.

- Usually the code that is executed on the server side implements the business logic of the problem that you trying to automate, using styles and solution patterns such as [RESTful API](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferencia_de_Estado_Representacional), [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), [SOLID](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), etc. It is also used to compose this type of solutions, frameworks such as [KsMf](https://github.com/ameksike/ksmf/wiki), [ExpressJs](https://expressjs.com/es/), [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/), etc.
